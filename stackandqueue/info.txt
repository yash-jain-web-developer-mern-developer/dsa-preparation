stack is just like plate stack and it work on filo and lifo
remove->pop
insert->push
take constant time complexity
internally it is an array
queue is just like movie ticket line and it work on fifo and lilo
deletion is happen at front end and insertion is happen at rear end
queue is an interface
it is use linkedlist internally
it take O(1) in insertion biy O(N) in deletion

for O(1) removal we use circular queue

deque
insert and remove from both the side
it internally no capacity restrivtion
it is faster than queue
