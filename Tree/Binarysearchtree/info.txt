search,insert,delete,find closest is O(logn) in balanced but O(H) in general,
sorted traversal O(n)
has table is best but it is best in find closest,sortest traversal,find ceil,floor,greater,smaller

in general it time complexity is o(H)
but if baleneced it is O(logn) which is mostly preferable

completely unbalanced are left skewed and right skewed 

In binary search tree organised in a way if we search so it escape half of array
so it like binary search

left value is smaller and right value is greater

Impliment by treeset and treemap

application of self balancing tree
1.To maintain  sorted stream of data(or sorted set of data)
2.To Impliment doubly  ended priority queue(find most priority and least priority patient)find maximum and minimum in O(1)
3.To solve problem
  1.count smaller/greaater in a stream 
  2.floor/ceil/greater/smaller in a stream
