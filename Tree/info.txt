we have hirearchy structure like folder,organisation level we use tree ds
1.node at top of hirearchy called rootnode
2. node just above the node is called parent node
3.each tree contain various subtree
4.degree of node is equal to number of children
5.node at bootom of tree is called leaf node
6.node other than leaf node is called internal node
Application
1.hirearchy-> organisation structure
2.folder
3.xml/html content
4.inheritance
5.binary search tree
6.binary heap
7.b and b+ tree
8.spanning tree used by bridges
   shortest tree by router
9.parse tree and expression tree in compiler
10. suffix tree to find fast search pattern in string
11. binary index tree and segment tree range query searching segment tree are more powerful
and binary index tree is more fast at particular length
